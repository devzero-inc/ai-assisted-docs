# Introducing DevZero

## What is DevZero?

DevZero is a cloud-based development platform that empowers engineers to build, test, and debug their applications more efficiently.

With DevZero, your entire application or service infrastructure is centrally defined and instantly deployable to a name-spaced developer box running on super-fast machines in the cloud. These developer environments directly mirror their production counterparts too. Gone are the days of stack drift, "it worked on my local machine" bugs, and waiting hours for your application to compile.

DevZero will have you and your team shipping faster and with more confidence.

## Who is DevZero for?

DevZero is designed for developers, teams, and organizations of all sizes who want to accelerate their product velocity and improve productivity.

DevZero is for developers who want to focus on building important things without managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting their local environments.

## Where does DevZero fit?

Check out this summary of how DevZero fits into your workflows.

## How to run DevZero

- **Console** - the DevZero Console ([console.devzero.io](https://console.devzero.io)) provides a browser-based experience and includes functions such as organization settings, cost reporting, and template management. This Quickstart Guide focuses on the Console experience only.
- **CLI** - the DevZero Command Line Interface enables you to interface with your developer environments from your local machine.
- **IDE** - we provide native IDE integrations to seamlessly mesh with your existing workflows.

## Whose cloud does it run on?

You can run DevZero on our cloud (e.g., Fully Hosted) just like with this guided demo. Or, if you prefer, DevZero can be self-hosted within your own cloud provider. DevZero is compatible with all major cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## What integrations are available?

DevZero is compatible with most services offered by the "big-3" cloud providers (AWS, GCP, and Azure). For Git providers, we provide native integrations for both GitHub and GitLab. In addition, we offer first-class support and extensions for VScode and JetBrains IDEs.
