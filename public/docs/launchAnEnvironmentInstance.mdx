# Launch an Environment Instance

Now we'll go through launching your first workspace with DevZero. Make sure you're ready to start by ensuring the following steps have been completed:

1. **Log in to [console.devzero.io/try](https://console.devzero.io/try)** - Ensure you're logged into the platform. If you haven't created an account yet, [please follow these instructions](#).

2. **Choose a Workspace Template** - After logging in, you'll see the homepage, which displays several pre-populated workspace templates. These templates are typically created and managed by a DevOps or Developer Productivity team for their engineers. However, they are straightforward enough for individual setup. For the purpose of this Quickstart, pick a template that interests you and select the **Launch** button.

3. **First Launch Process** - The initial launch may take a bit longer as your environment is being built. Future launches will proceed much quicker.

4. **Access Your Environment** - Once your environment is ready and running, you should receive a prompt to **Open in Web Browser**. If you don't see this prompt, look for and click a purple button to proceed.

5. **Explore the Web IDE** - For this Quickstart, we'll use a Web IDE connected to your instance. You're encouraged to explore the Web IDE's features and functionality. Remember, outside of this Quickstart, you're free to use your preferred IDE.

6. **Next Steps** - After exploring the Web IDE, return to the web console to continue learning, particularly about Environment Templates in the next section of the documentation.
